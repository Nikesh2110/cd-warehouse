Customers can buy CDs, searching on the title and the
artist. Their credit card payment is processed by an external provider. Record labels send batches of CDs to the warehouse. Keep a
stock count of how many copies of each title are in the warehouse.
Customers can leave reviews for CDs theyâ€™ve bought through the
warehouse, which gives each title an integer rating from 1- 10 and
the text of their review if they want to say more.
